## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Jingo", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Jingo Labs**: The company which developed the Jingo protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The Jingo Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **The Jingo Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Jingo protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Jingo protocol.
- **Jingo Governance**: A governance system for governing the Jingo Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.
