# The Jingo V3 Smart Contracts

Welcome to the Jingo V3 smart contracts documentation.

The pages here contain guides and technical documentation for the Jingo V3 Smart Contracts.
You can use these docs to learn about the V3 Protocol Smart Contracts and develop on-chain integrations.

# Guides

If you are new to the Jingo Protocol, we recommend you start with the [basic concepts](../../concepts/protocol) first.

You can then setup your [local environment](./guides/local-environment) and execute your [first swap](./guides/swaps/single-swaps).

# Reference

For a deeper dive, read through the [technical reference](./reference/overview) docs.
