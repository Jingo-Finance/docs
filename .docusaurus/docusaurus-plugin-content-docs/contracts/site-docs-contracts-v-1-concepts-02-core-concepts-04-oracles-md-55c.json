  "description": "A price oracle is any tool used to view price information about a given asset. When you look at stock prices on your phone, you are using your phone as a price oracle. Similarly, the app on your phone relies on devices to retrieve price information - likely several, which are aggregated and then displayed to you, the end-user. These are price oracles as well.",
